## How to install FormBuilder 

1. Form Builder requires ProcessWire 3.0.123 or newer. Make sure you update your ProcessWire
   version before installing Form Builder.

2. Unzip and place the files in `/site/modules/FormBuilder/`. 

3. In the ProcessWire admin, click to: Modules > Refresh. 

4. Click “Install” for Form Builder. 

5. If instructed to, copy `/site/modules/FormBuilder/form-builder.php`   
   to `/site/templates/form-builder.php`

6. Enter your product key on the Form Builder module configuration screen and submit.

7. Review the configuration options and adjust as necessary, then submit.

8. Go to the Setup menu in your ProcessWire admin and click on Forms to begin using
   Form Builder! 

## Other modules included with FormBuilder

FormBuilder also includes these other modules that you may also want to install
(if they are not installed alongside FormBuilder already):

- **InputfieldFormBuilderFile:** Provides file upload/attachment capability for forms. 

- **InputfieldFormBuilderPageBreak:** Provides paginated form capability. 

- **InputfieldFormBuilderForm:** Provides form-within-form embed capability. 

- **InputfieldFormBuilderStripe:** Provides credit-card processing ability via Stripe.   
    *(Note that this module must be downloaded separately from the FormBuilder board).*

## Custom themes and frameworks

Form Builder comes with several different themes and frameworks that can be selected 
for styling any given form. These are located in: 

- `/site/modules/FormBuilder/frameworks/` (CSS frameworks)
- `/site/modules/FormBuilder/themes/` (jQuery UI themes)

If you would like to customize existing frameworks, themes, add frameworks/themes, or 
remove them, we recommend copying the contents of one of the directories above to 
the following location: 

- `/site/templates/FormBuilder/frameworks/`
- `/site/templates/FormBuilder/themes/`

You will need to create both the "FormBuilder" and "frameworks" and/or "themes" parts 
of that directory. You may copy all the frameworks and themes if you want to, or just 
specific ones. You may also add new ones. 

Once in place, Form Builder will use your custom directory rather than the one
it comes with. The benefit of this is that your custom frameworks/themes directories 
won't get overwritten during Form Builder upgrades. 

For more about creating Form Builder themes, see our Form Builder support board at
<https://processwire.com/talk/forum/18-form-builder-support/> (login required). 


## Support and upgrades forum

Your purchase of FormBuilder includes 1-year of support and upgrades. After 1-year
you can optionally renew support and upgrades on a yearly basis. Support and upgrades
are provided through the FormBuilder support forum located at this URL:

<https://processwire.com/talk/forum/18-form-builder-support/>

Note that you must be logged in to the forums under the account you purchased 
FormBuilder with in order to access the support board. 

If your support/upgrades period has expired and you would like to renew it, but 
don't have an active renewal invoice (or aren't sure how to get one) please email
ryan@processwire.com to request a new renewal invoice. 


## Upgrading FormBuilder

Download the latest version of FormBuilder at:
<https://processwire.com/talk/topic/1844-form-builder-download/>

To install an upgrade do the following:

1. If you have customized any of the themes and they are located in the Form Builder
   modules directory, we recommend following the instructions under the Custom Themes 
   section of this document first. 

2. Replace the entire contents of your `/site/modules/FormBuilder/` directory with 
   the contents of the new Form Builder zip file. 

3. If needed, replace your `/site/templates/form-builder.php` with the new one in 
   `/site/modules/FormBuilder/form-builder.php` (This step may not be necessary in 
   most upgrades, since this file rarely changes).
   
4. In your ProcessWire admin, click to: Modules > Refresh.    

Your Form Builder should now be upgraded.
